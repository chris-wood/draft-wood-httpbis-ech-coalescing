1.  Introduction

   The HTTP/2 connection reuse policy requires is stated as follows:

   Connections that are made to an origin server, either directly or
   through a tunnel created using the CONNECT method (Section 8.3), MAY
   be reused for requests with multiple different URI authority
   components.  A connection can be reused as long as the origin server
   is authoritative (Section 10.1).  For TCP connections without TLS,
   this depends on the host having resolved to the same IP address.

   For "https" resources, connection reuse additionally depends on
   having a certificate that is valid for the host in the URI.  The
   certificate presented by the server MUST satisfy any checks that the
   client would perform when forming a new TLS connection for the host
   in the URI.

   Thus, HTTPS connections require that the target resource hostname
   resolve to an IP address that matches that of the candidate
   connection for coalescing.  This IP address match ensures that
   clients connect to the same service.  If a server changes IP
   addresses as a means of mitigating hostname-to-IP bindings, clients
   are less likely to reuse connections.  This can have performance
   problems, due to requiring an extra connection setup phase, as well
   as privacy problems.

   In short, using unauthenticated IP addresses as a signal for
   connection reuse is fragile.  This document relaxes this requirement
   and introduces another signal based on HTTPS RR answer contents
   [HTTPS-RR].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  ECH-Based Coalescing Policy

   The HTTPS RR [HTTPS-RR] is a new resource record used for conveying
   service information about a HTTPS endpoint to clients.  Some of this
   information includes, for example, TLS Encrypted ClientHello (ECH)
   [TLS-ECH] public key material.  The set of hosts behind the same ECH
   client-facing service provider that share the same ECH and TLS
   configuration information is referred to as the anonymity set.
   Client-facing servers SHOULD deploy ECH in such a way so as to
   maximize the size of the anonymity set where possible.  This means
   client-facing servers should use the same ECH configuration
   (ECHConfig) for as many hosts as possible.

   This type of deployment model means that a given ECHConfig uniquely
   identifies a given service provider.  As a result, clients can use it
   as a signal to determine if a given resource is hosted by the same
   service provider.  Thus, the HTTP/2 connection reuse policy is
   modified to use this signal as follows:

   Connections that are made to an origin server, either directly or
   through a tunnel created using the CONNECT method (Section 8.3), MAY
   be reused for requests with multiple different URI authority
   components.  A connection can be reused as long as the origin server
   is authoritative (Section 10.1).  For TCP connections without TLS,
   this depends on the host having resolved to the same service
   provider.  Clients may implement this check in one of two ways: (1)
   by comparing for equality the resolved IP address to that of the
   original connection, or (2) by comparing for equality the "echconfig"
   SvcParamValue in the resolved HTTPS answer.  For the latter case, the
   original connection MUST have successfully used the "echconfig"
   parameter to negotiate TLS ECH.

4.  HTTP/3 Reuse

   The HTTP/3 connection reuse policy [HTTP3] does not require IP
   addresses to match.  However, as HTTP/3 is based on UDP, some clients
   may fall back to HTTP/2 over TCP in networks where UDP is blocked or
   otherwise inoperable.  Thus, the policy described in this document
   only applies to HTTP/2.

5.  Security Considerations

   Existing coalescing policies do not require IP address authentication
   via DNSSEC.  Thus, an adversary which can spoof A or AAAA responses
   can equally spoof HTTPS responses (and ECH key values).

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
